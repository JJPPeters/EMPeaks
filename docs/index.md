EMPeaks is a program written in python designed for interacting with an analysing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. It has two particular strengths:
 
 - OpenGL accelerate graphing allows for quick, easy interaction with your data (even for extremely large images)
 - Plug-in development to design and perform your own analysis (using scipy for example)

EMPeaks is heavily in development and many features are only partially implemented.
